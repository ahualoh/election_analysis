# election_analysys

## Project Overview
The Colorado Board of Elections is aduting an election for the US Congressional precinct of Colorda. Given [election_results.csv](https://github.com/ahualoh/election_analysis/blob/main/resources/election_results.csv), it displayed a ballot ID, the county where the ballot counted, and the candidate voted for. We need to generate a report that displays this following: 

1. Total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Total number of votes each candidate received
4. Percentage of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote
